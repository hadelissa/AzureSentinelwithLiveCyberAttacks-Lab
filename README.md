<h1>Azure Sentinel Live Cyber Attacks Home Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab I configured Azure Sentinel SIEM and linked it to a running virtual machine that was set up as a honey pot. By doing so, I was able to monitor RDP Brute Force attacks from various locations worldwide. Additionally, I have used a customized PowerShell script that retrieves geolocation details of the attackers and displays them on the Azure Sentinel Map.
